# Hi there,

About Twenty Four 7

Twenty Four 7 provides technology services for a great number of clients around the world. We have a presence in Europe (Poland, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Turkey, Ukraine), and North and South America. Our HQ is in California. We have subsidiaries in Finland and Ireland.

We currently have over 500 employees worldwide. We come from different backgrounds but we love what we do. We build meaningful relationships with respect, equality, and integrity.

All our engineers have direct access to our management, we are more results-oriented, and we donâ€™t like working in a bureaucratic environment.

Currently, we are looking for experts to develop, review, debug and deploy Blockchain projects based on Solidity and to strengthen our Blockchain division Protofire. Also you will have a chance to participate in bootstrapping new blockchain or parachain networks using Rust based frameworks (i.e. Substrate, Solana). 

Protofire is a decentralized autonomous organization meaning that Protofire members are working autonomously, receive profit shares monthly, and have the opportunity to contribute to the best blockchain projects.

There are some facts about Protofire:
- Founded in 2016, super-early adopters of Ethereum
- Helped Avalanche to get the bridge and the first 500mln$.
- Worked with MakerDAO (did a governance dashboard for them & liquidation bots).
- We are the founders of Solhint
- All our customers are top 100 products on coinmarketcap.com: Safe (ex-Gnosis), Maple, Chainlink, and The Graph.
- We created our organization as a DAO, where everyone has a right to vote
- Every team at Protofire has a monthly profit shares
